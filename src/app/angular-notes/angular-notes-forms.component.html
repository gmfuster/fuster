    To use forms, <b>import &lbrace; FormsModule, ReactiveFormsModule  &rbrace; from '@angular/forms';</b>  Also include them under the imports in the 
    app.module.ts.<br/>  Angular will create a JavaScript representation of our form (which we indicate with the html form).  To tell Angular that one of 
    the elements needs to be a control, we use ngModel and we need to set the name attribute (html attribute) to something. <b>&lt;input... ngModel name="someName"</b><br/>
    In your Submit button, don't call your submit event in the ts file from the (click) of the button.  Instead, set the type of the button to submit and 
    use the ngSubmit in your form html element.  <b>&lt;form (ngSubmit) = "onSubmit()"...</b>

    <p class="HeadingSubTopic">Some basic form</p>   
    Just doing a little form here:<br/>
    <pre>
      <code>
        &lt;form (ngSubmit)="onSubmit(f)" #f&gt;
          &lt; input type="number" ngModel name="theNumber" /&gt;
          &lt; button type="submit"&gt;Submit HTMLFormElement &lt; /button &gt;
        &lt;/form &gt;
      </code>
    </pre>
    <form (ngSubmit)="onSubmit(f)" #f>
      <input type="number" ngModel name="theNumber"/>
      <button type="submit">Submit HTMLFormElement</button>
    </form>
    You need to have the onSubmit(f) in the ts file.  (or onSubmit() if you don't need anything passed).  The way the function is above, the f 
    being passed will be the html form.  <br/>
    The form below is similar to the one above, except we have <b>(ngSubmit)="onSubmit(f2)" #f2="ngForm"</b>.  That means that what gets passed to onSubmit will 
    be the JS object and not the HTMLFormElement.  This object is the representation Angular has for the form.  With the controls that we mark with ngModel being there.<br/>
    <form (ngSubmit)="onSubmit(f2)" #f2="ngForm">
      <input type="number" ngModel name="theNumber"/>
      <button type="submit">Submit JS object</button>
    </form>

    <!--<hr class="hrClass" />-->
    
    <p class="HeadingSubTopic">ViewChild</p>  

    Another way to access the form from the ts file is the   
    <a href="/angular-notes/#viewchild">ViewChild</a>
    <!--TODO figure out why this doesn't work and fix instead of just using the href above-->
    <!--<a [routerLink]='["/angular-notes"]' fragment="viewchild">ViewChild</a>--> mentioned in the base notes.<br/>

    For the form above, using viewchild would look like this:<br/>
    <form (ngSubmit)="onSubmitNA()" #f3="ngForm">
      <input type="number" ngModel name="theNumber"/>
      <button type="submit">Submit with viewchild</button>
    </form>
    The form is similar to the above ones but notice the differences here:
    <pre>
      <code>
        form (ngSubmit)="onSubmitNA<b>()</b>" #f3="ngForm"
      </code>
    </pre>
    And in the ts file, to get the form:
    <pre>
      <code>
        <b>@ViewChild('f3') myForm : NgForm | undefined; </b>
        //it will be NgForm but need to say it could be undefined because not initializing it in constructor.
        //then later in the onSubmitNA.
        alert(this.myForm);
      </code>
    </pre>

    <!--<hr class="hrClass" />-->
    <p class="HeadingSubTopic">Validation</p>  
    In the form below we have the input number as <b>required</b>.  That means we can still submit it, but if we check it in the console we will see valid:false.<br/>
    <b>Make sure you don't have the same id for different forms because then you will be using the first one found in the ts file.</b>  You could also have <b>
      email</b> in a field.  If the email entered is not valid, the form will also be valid:false. Not only the form is not valid, whatever control is making it 
      fail will also be invalid.  Inspecting the element in the browser will also include some information on the fields, including an ng-invalid when or ng-valid tags.

  <form (ngSubmit)="onSubmitNA()" #f4="ngForm">
    <input type="number" ngModel name="theNumber" required/>
    <button type="submit">Submit with required</button>
  </form>
  Another form here checking the form for its validity.  If not valid (no number on required field, disable the button).
  <form (ngSubmit)="onSubmitNA()" #f5="ngForm">
    <input type="number" ngModel name="theNumber" required/>
    <button type="submit" [disabled]="!f5.valid">Submit with required</button>
  </form>
  The above form looks like this<br/>
  <pre>
    <code>
      &lt;form (ngSubmit)="onSubmitNA()" #f5="ngForm"&gt;
      &lt;input type="number" ngModel name="theNumber" <b>required</b>/&gt;
      &lt;button type="submit" <b>[disabled]="!f5.valid"</b>&gt;Submit with required&lt;/button&gt;
    </code>
  </pre>
  Since Angular is going to add those ng-invalid labels to the invalid firms and form, we can take advantage of that by creating a css class with the same names.
  For the forms here I have:
  <pre>
    <code>
      input.ng-invalid&lbrace;
        background-color: firebrick;
    &rbrace;
    </code>
  </pre>
  We could also have something like this <b>input.ng-invalid.ng-touched</b> and it won't be marked until the user has done something in the field and left it.

  <!--<hr class="hrClass" />-->
  <p class="HeadingSubTopic">Validation Messages</p>  
  This form shows a text if the value in the input is valid (a number)
  <form (ngSubmit)="onSubmitNA()" #f5="ngForm">
    <input type="number" ngModel name="theNumber" #theNumber= "ngModel" required/>
    <button type="submit" [disabled]="!f5.valid">Submit with required</button>
    <span *ngIf="theNumber.valid">Will show if value is valid.</span>
  </form>
  The form is like the previous one with some additions:<br/>
  <pre>
    <code>
      ...
      &lt;input type="number" ngModel name="theNumber" <b>#theNumber= "ngModel"</b> required/&gt;
      ...
      &lt;span <b>*ngIf="theNumber.valid"</b>&gt;Will show if value is valid.&lt;/span&gt;
    </code>
  </pre>
  You could also use ! in the if if you want it to show when it is not valid.  Also, you could include theNumber.touched in the if if you want it to 
  just happen once the user has changed something on it.  

 <!--<hr class="hrClass" />-->
  <p class="HeadingSubTopic">Default Values</p>  
  We can now use ngModel with the brackets and set it to a hardcoded value or a variable from the ts file.
  <form (ngSubmit)="onSubmitNA()">
    <input type="number" [ngModel]=9 name="theNumber" #theNumber= "ngModel" required/>    
  </form>
  <pre>
    <code>
      input type="number" [ngModel]=9
    </code>
  </pre>


  <!--<hr class="hrClass" />-->
  <p class="HeadingSubTopic">Grouping Form Controls</p>  
  You can have a div around a few controls and have them be grouped when Angular converts the form to an object.  To do that you use <b>ngModelGroup</b>
  <form (ngSubmit)="onSubmit6()" #f6="ngForm">
    <div ngModelGroup="InputButtonGroup">
      <input type="number" ngModel name="theNumber"/>
      <input type="number" ngModel name="theNumber2"/>      
    </div>
    <button type="submit" name="theButton">Submit</button>
  </form>
  Notice below that the form has been changed to f6 now.
  <pre>
    <code>
      &lt;form (ngSubmit)="onSubmit6()" #f6="ngForm"&gt;
        &lt;div ngModelGroup="InputButtonGroup"&gt;
          &lt;input type="number" ngModel name="theNumber"/&gt;
          &lt;input type="number" ngModel name="theNumber2"/&gt;         
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;button type="submit" name="theButton">Submit&lt;/button&gt;
      &lt;/form&gt;      
    </code>
  </pre>
  Now on the conlole you can see:<br/>
  <pre>
    <samp>
      ngForm
      ...
      value:object
      InputButtonGroup...
    </samp>
  </pre>
  You will also have the group under controls in the ngForm.  That means you can access properties on it like you would other controls.
  We could also now set the group as we did the form and pass that group to the ts file.
  <form (ngSubmit)="onSubmitGroup()" #f6="ngForm">
    <div ngModelGroup="InputButtonGroup" #InputButtonGroup="ngModelGroup">
      <input type="number" ngModel name="theNumber"/>
      <input type="number" ngModel name="theNumber2"/>      
    </div>
    <button type="submit" name="theButton">Submit</button>
  </form>
  <pre>
    <code>
      &lt;div ngModelGroup="InputButtonGroup" <b>#InputButtonGroup="ngModelGroup"</b>&gt;
      ...
      form (ngSubmit)="onSubmitGroup()
      ...
      //And in the ts us we have added the @ViewChild('InputButtonGroup') myFormGroup
    </code>
  </pre>

 <!--<hr class="hrClass" />-->
  <p class="HeadingSubTopic">Radio Buttons</p>  
  <div>
    {{optionR}}  <br/>
    <input type="radio" ngModel name="radio" value="1" (click)="optionR='1'"/>One
    <input type="radio" ngModel name="radio" value="2" (click)="optionR='2'"/>Two        
  </div>
  <pre>
    <code ngNonBindable>
      &lbrace;&lbrace; optionR &rbrace;&rbrace; 
    ...input type="radio" ngModel name="radio" value="1" (click)="optionR='1'"...
    ...input type="radio" ngModel name="radio" value="2" (click)="optionR='2'"...
    </code>
  </pre> 


 <!--<hr class="hrClass" />-->
  Note: Once you have the form in your ts file (the #f we did in code above) you can access the controls in it with yourform.form. and the methods 
  available.  You can use that to manipulate the values in the form.  You can also reset the values from reset() directly on yourform.

  <br/><br/>
  <br/>
  <span  id="reactive"></span>
  <br/>
    <h3  class="CenterMe">
      <!--<a  href="/angular-notes-svc-routing/#routing">Jump To Routing</a>-->
      <a  [routerLink]='["/angular-notes-forms"]' fragment="template" >Jump To Template Forms</a>
    </h3>
  <hr class="hrHeaderClass"/>
  <h2 class="CenterMe" >Reactive Forms</h2>
  <hr class="hrHeaderClass"/>



  <p class="HeadingSubTopic">The controls</p>   
  Ehe controls for this form are created in the ts code.<br/>
  Angular provides tools to do that.  For example, FromGroups (import &lbrace;FormGroup &rbrace; from '@angular\forms' )<br/>
  For this approach you don't need FormsModule in your app.module but you need to import and declare the ReactiveFormsModule.

  <form [formGroup] = "myReactiveForm">
    <input type="number" name="theNumber" formControlName = "number1"/><br/>
    <input type="number" name="theNumber2" formControlName = "number2"/><br/>
    <div>
      <input type="radio"  formControlName = "radioButton" value="1"/>One
      <input type="radio"  formControlName = "radioButton" value="2" />Two     
  </div>
  </form>

  for the above form, in the ts side we can have code like this:
  <pre>
    <code>
      myReactiveForm: FormGroup ; //do not just assign something here, do it in the ngOnInit. May have to assign an empty one in the constructor for it to compile
      ...
      his.myReactiveForm = new FormGroup(&lbrace;
        "number1" : new FormControl(),
        "number2" : new FormControl(),
        "radioButton" : new FormControl('2')//give default value of 2 to the radio button
      &rbrace;);

      in the html, to link the elements to the controls:
      input type="number" name="theNumber" <b>formControlName = "number1"</b>
      input type="number" name="theNumber2" formControlName = "number2"
      input type="radio"  <b>formControlName = "radioButton"</b> value="1"
      input type="radio"  <b>formControlName = "radioButton"</b> value="2"

      for the form tag itself, you also need to <b>[formGroup]</b> = "myReactiveForm"
    </code>
  </pre>

  For submiting the form, we can still use (onSubmit) = "onSubmitOrWhatever()" but we don't need to pass a reference to the form itself (like we 
  did with #f before) since we already have the form control in the ts code now.<br/>


  <p class="HeadingSubTopic">Validation</p>   
  For the validation, you can pass another argument to FormControl in the ts code ('whatever':new FormControl (null , <b>Validators.required</b>)).
  Notice you don't add () after required.  And you will have to import Validators from @angular/forms.  You could also pass an array of validators instead of 
  just one.<br/>
  If we wanted to display a message depending on the validity of one of the controls in the form, it could be something like this:<br/>
  <pre>
    <code>
      &lt;span&gt;*ngIf = "!myReactiveForm.get('number2').valid"...myReactiveForm.get('number2').touched...

      //you could also check valid and touched for the whole myReactiveForm.
    </code>
  </pre>
  <br/>

  <p class="HeadingSubTopic">Group controls</p>   
  Like in template forms, you can also group controls here (a FormGroup taking as ar argument an object with 2 or more FormGroups.)  Now to find the control you 
  want you need to give the path to the control that is inside the other control.  For example, if you have a FormGroup (AB) in the ts code with FormGroups A and B, in the 
  html code you need to set the div holding the A and B with <b>formGroupName = "AB"</b>.  Now in the HTML code, you will <b>usemyReactiveForm.get(AB.A) or myReactiveForm.get(AB.B).</b>

  <br/>
  You can also access the controls as an array (that you have previously added as members of the FormArray,which you need to import too.). 
  You can have a getControls method that returns 
  <b>(&lbrace;FormArray&rbrace;this.myReactiveForm.get('whatevergroup')).controls.</b> You could have used <b>as FormArray</b> in the code too.

  Then use them in the html code.

  <br/>
  In the HTML, for the div that will hold the array elements, also use a <b>formArrayName="AB"</b> similar to like we did for formGroupName.

  <br/>

  <p class="HeadingSubTopic">Check for Specific Errors</p>   
  When we are checking if an element is valid (like myReactiveForm.get('number2').valid), we can also check for specific errors 
  myReactiveForm.get('number2').errors['required'] (or any of the other Angular or custom errors).<br/>
  <br/>
  Custom validations are also possible with reactive forms. To add a new validator create a new function that takes a FormControl as an argument. It should return
  an object which has a key value pair, the key being a string and the value being a boolean. <b>IF VALIDATION IS SUCCESSFUL YOU MUST RETURN NULL OR NOTHING.  DO 
  NOT RETURN THE OBJECT WITH false. </b>  To use your validation function, don't forget to include it in the array of validators in the new FormControl statement.
  DO NOT EXECUTE THE FUNCTION WIHT THE ().  YOU ALSO HAVE TO BIND IT.
  <pre>
    <code>
      //if you had a function like This
      <b>myValidation(control:FormControl) : &lbrace;[s:string]:boolean &rbrace; ...
      return &lbrace; 'isThisThinInvalid':true &rbrace;</b>
      ....
      //or if valid 
      return null;


      //you would have this in the creation of the control.
      <b>this.myValidation.bind(this)</b>
    </code>
  </pre>

  <p class="HeadingSubTopic">Custom Async Validator</p>   
  Sometimes we may need to do some validation in the server, so we need async validators.<br/>
  In this case the function will still take as an argument a FormControl variable, but it will return a Promise&lt;any&gt; or an Observable  also of any.<br/>
  For the observable, import it from rxjs/Observable.<br/>
  A control with a regular validator, a custom one, and a custom async one would look something like this:
  <pre>
    <code>
      this.myForm = new FormGroup(&lbrace;
        ...bunch of controls
         'someOtherControl': new FormControl(null, [Validators.required, Validators.myOwnVal],
        this.someCustomAsyncVal)&rbrace;)
    </code>
  </pre>

  <b>To react to changes in validation,</b> in the form itself (that you create with the FormGroup) you can listen to status changes and value changes. You can subscribe 
  to those with <b>this.myForm.valueChanges.subscribe( value=> Console.log("whatever"))</b>.  <br/>
  You can also use setValue here to change the controls (similar to with template forms).  Same for patchValue.
