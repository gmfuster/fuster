        </h3>

        When you create an Angular app with VSC, it will create the initial routing for you:<br/>
        app.module.ts will have: <code ngNonBindable>import &lbrace; AppRoutingModule &rbrace; from './app-routing.module';</code><br/>
        Which has: <code ngNonBindable>import &lbrace; RouterModule, Routes &rbrace; from '@angular/router';</code> and includes routes such as:<br/>
        <code ngNonBindable>const routes: Routes = [  &lbrace; path: '', component: HomeComponent, pathMatch: 'full' &rbrace;,...</code><br/>
        <code ngNonBindable>@NgModule( &lbrace; imports: [RouterModule.forRoot(routes)], exports: [RouterModule] &rbrace;)</code><br/>
        <br/>
        The forRoot is what registers the routes.  Without this, they will not work.<br/>
        Whatever paths and components are indicated in the routes, they will be loaded on <code ngNonBindable>&lt;router-outlet&gt;</code><br/>
        Once we have the routes set up, we could use them in the href of a link and that would work, but that would refresh the whole 
        page, which is not what we want when we are using Angular and its components.  Using the routes with href is like typing the 
        address on the browser.<br/>
        Instead use routerLink.  In the Home component, there is a link to read backwards, like this:
        <code ngNonBindable>&lt;a [routerLink]='["/read-back"]' &gt;&lt;/a&gt;</code> <br/>
        <a [routerLink]="['/read-back']"  >
            Click it and come back
        </a>
        <br/><br/>

        NOTE: If you are getting an error that it cannot find routerLink, make sure you introduced the component to the app.module.ts or whatever
        module it should belong to.<br/>
        Make sure you test all your links.  You don't want to end up using an absolute path when you need a relative path or viceversa.  <br/>
        Use <code>[routerLinkActive]</code> set to a class to indicate what the link will look like when it is the active one (Angular will handle the how it knows)
        .  To use the Bootstrap one, just set it to "active".<br/>
        Use <code>[routerLinkActiveOptions]='&lbrace; exact: true &rbrace;'</code> to indicate for a link to be active it has to match the path exactly.
        If you don't, you will always have the home link active because all your other paths will include /, which is the home one.<br/>
        <br/>
        Besides links, we can also navigate through buttons or in the code. <br/>
        To use in a button on your code, import it in the ts file of the component, and add it to the constructor<br/>
        <code>import &lbrace; Router &rbrace; from '@angular/router';</code><br/>
        <code>constructor ( private router:Router)</code><br/>
        <code> In the event code ==> this.router.navigate(["/read-back"]);</code><br/>
        <button (click)="onClickToRouteSomewhereElse()">Click me to go somewhere else</button><br/>
        Note: Keep in mind that the code in the ts file doesn't know where you currently are, like it would happen with the routerLink.<br/>
        There is a way to get that information though, and that is by adding <code>ActivatedRoute</code> to the import, and then, we 
        can pass this as a second parameter to navigate <code>&lbrace;relativeTo:this.route&rbrace;</code>. This.route will contain where we are at the time.
        <br/><br/>

       <!--<hr class="hrClass" />-->
        
        <p class="HeadingSubTopic">dynamic Paths</p>  
        <code>this.router.navigate(["/dynamic-notes/" + sendId]);  </code>
        <code>import &lbrace; ActivatedRoute, Router &rbrace; from '@angular/router';</code><br/>
        <code>constructor(private route:ActivatedRoute)</code><br/>
        <code>this.id = Number(this.route.snapshot.params['id']); </code><br/>    
        <code>path: 'dynamic-notes/:id'</code>    <br/>
        We can have dynamic paths, which will look like like <code>path:"users/:id", component:userComponent</code>. The part after : is the part
        that will be dynamic.<br/>
        I have a component just to show the data from the path on the screen. It will just take the id from the path and display it.<br/>
        <button (click)="onDynamicNotesClicked()">Go with no id (will def to 999)</button>  <br/>
        <button (click)="onDynamicNotesClicked(50)">Go with id as 50</button>  <br/>
        You can also type some other number on the url and you will see it.<br/>      
        You can have more than one dynamic parameter in the path.  You will get each one with snapshot.params.<br/>
        If you have the button requesting a different user on the same component where you are showing the data, the component will not reload
        just because the parameter changed, so you may not see the data you expect on the page.  But you can subscribe to the params changing so you 
        can update your variables when the path changes. <code>this.route.params.subscribe(params:Params => &lbrace; code to update your variables &rbrace;);, access 
            with params['whateverparameteryouused']
        </code>
        <br/><br/>

        <!--<hr class="hrClass" />-->


                 
         <p class="HeadingSubTopic">dynamic Paths with dynamic part in the middle</p>  
         You could add something else after the dynamic element of the path, something like this: <code>... path: 'dynamic-notes/:id/<b>edit</b>', ...</code>
         The link could be something like <code>[routerLink]='["/dynamic-notes",5, "edit" ]'</code><br/>
        
         When you are using [routerLink] and you need to pass parameters with data (usually passed after the ? on the link), you can add 
         <code>[queryParams]="&lbrace;param1:'value1', param2:'value2'&rbrace;"</code>.  Now param1 and param2 will show up in the link after the ?.  The 
         parameters will be separated with &.  With this you can also add a fragment="Loading or whatever" and that will add #Loading or whatever at the end of the link. 

         To do the same in code, you would use :<br/>
         <code>this.router.navigate(["/dynamic-notes/" + sendId, "edit"], &lbrace; queryParams: &lbrace;param1:'value1', param2:'value2'&rbrace;, fragment:'loading'  &rbrace; ); </code>

         <br/>

         To get the parameters it is similar to other things fro the link: this.route.snapshot.queryParams, this.route.snapshot.fragment.  We can also subscribe to those.
        

         <br/>

       <!--<hr class="hrClass" />-->     
         <p class="HeadingSubTopic">Nested Routing</p>  

         I you end up with different routes that have the same at the beginning of the path, you may be better of changing them to have a main path, and 
         then children paths (routes) under it. For example, if you have paths:<br/>         
         &lbrace; path: 'commonpath', component: SomeComponent&rbrace;,<br/>
         &lbrace; path: 'commonpath/:id', component: SomeComponentId&rbrace;,<br/>
         &lbrace;path: 'commonpath/:id/edit', component: SomeComponentIdEdit&rbrace;,<br/>


         You can split it up in a parent and its children, like this:<br/>
         <code>
         &lbrace; path: 'commonpath', component: SomeComponent, children: [<br/>
            &nbsp;&lbrace; path: ':id', component: SomeComponentId&rbrace;,<br/>
            &nbsp;&lbrace; path: ':id/edit', component: SomeComponentIdEdit&rbrace;,<br/>
            ]&rbrace;
        </code>
        <br/>
        <b>When we have nested routes, we also need rested router-outlets. </b> In this case, the SomeComponent will load in the main router-outlet 
        and this SomeComponent html should have another router-outlet where the child will load.<br/>
        If you want to navigate to a child from SomeComponent, you could do it like this:<br/>
        <code>this.router.navigate(['commonpath', someidvarintparentcomponent, 'edit']);</code><br/>
        or<br/>
        <code>this.router.navigate(['edit'] , &lbrace; this.route &rbrace;);</code><br/>
        If we are using the queryParams from the parent in the navigation, we will lose them when we navigate.  To preserve them, do this :
        <code>this.router.navigate(['edit'], &lbrace;relativeTo: this.route, <b>queryParamsHandling: 'preserved' </b>&rbrace; ) </code>


       <!--<hr class="hrClass" />-->       
         <p class="HeadingSubTopic">Redirect</p>  
         You can redirect from one path to another one with something like &lbrace;path:'somepath or **', <b>redirectTo</b>:'some other path'&rbrace;
         The ** means any unknown route, and it should be the last entry under the routes array.  With redirect, use the pathMatch:'full'<br/>

        <br/><br/>

       <!--<hr class="hrClass" />-->      
        <p class="HeadingSubTopic">CanActivate and CanActivateChild</p>  
        We can create a service and have it implement CanActivate.  The CanActivate will apply to whatever route we use it in and its children.<br/>
        We could have this route that uses the service to see if we can go to that route:<br/>
        <code>path: 'angular-notes-noactivate', component: ..., <b>canActivate:[ForCanActivate]</b>, pathMatch: 'full'</code><br/>
        Remember to add the service to  app.module providers. (Make sure they are also added to the imports)<br/>
        Just for the notes, the service is going to return false the whole time.  Which means, if we try to go to the route that has the CanActivate, it will not work<br/>

        <pre>
            <code>
                import &lbrace;ActivatedRouteSnapshot, CanActivate, RouterStateSnapshot&rbrace; from '@angular/router';

                export class ForCanActivate implements CanActivate&lbrace;
                    //could return Promise&lt;boolean&gt; if this is run asynchronously.  Could also return a boolean. Or Observable&lt;boolean&gt;
                    canActivate(route:ActivatedRouteSnapshot, state:RouterStateSnapshot):boolean&lbrace;
                        //could have other code here checking to see if the route can be activated or not
                        //could be calling other services or whatever.
                        return false;
                    &rbrace;
                &rbrace;
            </code>
        </pre>
        But what if what we want to protect are just the children and not the link itself?  You can also implement CanActivateChild on the 
        same service we were using, and then have a similar function like this<br/>
        <pre>
            <code>
                canActivateChild(route:ActivatedRouteSnapshot, state:RouterStateSnapshot):boolean&lbrace;
                    //return whatever you need
                    return false;
                &rbrace;
            </code>
        </pre>

        On the route, now it would be <code>path: 'angular-notes-noactivate', component: ..., <b>canActivateChid:[ForCanActivate]</b></code>


       <!--<hr class="hrClass" />-->       
        <p class="HeadingSubTopic">CanDeactivate</p>   
        I am using the same path I used for the noactivate, but, to test the deactivate it has to be activated so I have to change the canActivate to return 
        true instead of false.<br/>
        In the service file, same one I used before, now we are doing this:<br/>
        <pre>
            <code>
                export interface ForCanDeActivateInt &lbrace;
                    //could be Promise&lt;boolean&gt; if this is run asyncronously.  Could also be a boolean. Or Observable&lt;boolean&gt;
                    canDeactivate: () => boolean;    
                &rbrace;
                export class ForCanDeActivate implements CanDeactivate&lt;ForCanDeActivateInt&gt;&lbrace;
                    //will be called when we try to deactivate a route
                    canDeactivate(<b>component</b>:ForCanDeActivateInt, route:ActivatedRouteSnapshot,state:RouterStateSnapshot, nextState?:RouterStateSnapshot):Observable&lt;boolean&gt; 
                            | boolean | Promise:&lt;boolean&gt;&lbrace;
                                return <b>component.canDeactivate();</b>
                            &rbrace;
                &rbrace;
            </code>
        </pre>
        Because we are returning the component canDeactivate, we need to go to the ts file of the component for that route. It needs to implement ForCanDeActivate.<br/>
        <pre>
            <code>
                export class AngularNotesComponent implements OnInit, <b>ForCanDeActivate </b>

                ...

                canDeactivate(): Promise&lt;boolean&gt; | Observable&lt;boolean&gt; | boolean
                &lbrace;
                    //logic to decide whether we can leave the route or not
                    alert("Can I deactivate? yes");
                    return true;
                &rbrace;
            </code>
        </pre>
        Now also import and set as provider in the app.module.ts<br/>
        <pre>
            <code>
                providers: [OtherServices, ForCanActivate, ForCanDeActivate],
            </code>
        </pre>
        And on the route itself:<br/>
        <pre>
            <code>
                canDeactivate:[ForCanDeActivate]
            </code>
        </pre>
        Now when we are on that route and we choose to go somewhere else, the canDeactivate in the ts file of the component will be called.  Depending on the 
        return we will be able to leave the route or not.<br/>

        <img width="100%" src="assets\images\angular\candeactivate.png" alt="can deactivate" /><br/><br/>
        <!--<hr class="hrClass" />-->
    
        <p class="HeadingSubTopic">Pass Static Data to not-found</p>   
        This doesn't have to be for a not found page but using that to show it.  We have the ** to catch a route that doesn't exist, and we reroute it 
        to the not found page with this. Notice the data part of it, because that will be send to the ts file for that page.
        <pre>
            <code>
                &lbrace; path: 'not-found', component:NotFoundComponent, pathMatch:'full', data:&lbrace;message:"I AM THE MESSAGE FROM not-found!!!!"&rbrace;&rbrace;,
                &lbrace; path: '**', redirectTo:'not-found'&rbrace;,
            </code>
        </pre>
        Then on the ts and html files for the NotFoundComponent:
        <pre>
            <code ngNonBindable>
                constructor(private route:ActivatedRoute)&lbrace;&rbrace;

                this.errorMessage = this.route.snapshot.data['message'];

                //or use this if the data may change while we are here.
                //this.route.data.subscribe(
                // (data:Data) => this.errorMessage = data['message']);

                &lt;h3&gt;&lbrace;&lbrace;errorMessage&rbrace;&rbrace;&lt;/h3&gt;
            </code>
        </pre>


       <!--<hr class="hrClass" />-->
        <p class="HeadingSubTopic">Resolve Dynamic Data</p>   
        This is for when we need to get the data before to route somewhere.  We should create a new file, such as server-recolver.service.ts.  It should be 
        similar to:
        <pre>
            <code>
                import &lbrace;Resolve &rbrace; from '@angular/router'
                
                //it could resolve to a type, or an observable of the type, or a Promise of the type
                //if you need to inject other services, use @injectable and the constructor to get it.
                export class <b>ServerResolver</b> implements Resolve&lt;whatever type you will resolve &gt;

                resolve(route:ActivatedRouteSnapshot, state:RouterStateSnapshot)&lbrace;;
                    return whatever;
                &rbrace;
            </code>
        </pre>
        In the routing, before we had something like this:
        <pre>
            <code>
                path:"users/:id", component:userComponent
            </code>
        </pre>
        And now we can have this and when this route happens, the data coming from the ServerResolver will be stored in the server.  Then in the  component 
        that will be loaded, in this case, userComponent, we will have code to get the data.
        <pre>
            <code>
                path:"users/:id", component:userComponent, resolve: &lbrace;server:<b>ServerResolver</b>&rbrace;
            </code>
        </pre>
        And then, the code in the userComponent to get the data we need:
        <pre>
            <code>
                //on the ngOnInit (will need to import Data)
                this.route.data.subscribe(
                    (data:Data) => &lbrace;
                        this.whateveryourvariableis = data['server'];//this server comes from the 'server' you used in the path.
                    &rbrace;
                )
            </code>
        </pre>
        <br/>
        <br/>
