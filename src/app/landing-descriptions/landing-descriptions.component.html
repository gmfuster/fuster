      This is just a place to keep track of notes that I think can be useful to have at hand.  I am covering some programming
      languages and some math.  Feel free to send any suggestions of PRs that you feel could be added.  This doesn't have any tutorials
      and you are supposed to have an idea of how to search for what you are looking for.<br/><br/>
      I am interested in learning different things (some relearning) and I wanted somewhere to have it all together (besides Onenote).<br/>
      <br/>
      I have a few activities for kids (in React) under <a href="https://gmfuster.github.io/Bonico/#/" target="_new">https://gmfuster.github.io/Bonico/#/</a><br /><br />

      I wrote a couple of books because... why not? Everybody has to write a book, right?  Available in all Amazon stores, some also in Spanish.
